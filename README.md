# MediGuide: AI-Based Disease and Treatment Advisor  

**Live Demo:** [AI-Based Disease and Treatment Advisor](https://ai-based-disease-and-treatment-advisor.streamlit.app/)

## **Project Overview**  
MediGuide is an intelligent healthcare assistant designed to predict potential diseases based on user-entered symptoms. By leveraging advanced machine learning models, the app classifies diseases and provides detailed information, including:  
- Disease Descriptions  
- Precautionary Measures  
- Recommended Medications  
- Suggested Diet Plans  
- Appropriate Workouts  

## **Objective**  
The objective of MediGuide is to make healthcare insights more accessible and personalized by:  
1. Predicting diseases based on user input.  
2. Offering relevant and actionable advice to users.  
3. Empowering users to take informed steps toward better health.  

## **Methodology/Methods**  
MediGuide employs the following workflow:  
1. **Data Collection**: Utilizes curated datasets of symptoms and diseases for training machine learning models.  
2. **Symptom Matching**: Takes input symptoms to predict potential diseases using trained classification models.  
3. **Disease Prediction**: Classifies diseases using algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.  
4. **Information Display**: Retrieves disease-related information (precautions, medications, diets, etc.) from a knowledge base.  

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python  
- Streamlit (Frontend)  
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)  
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
